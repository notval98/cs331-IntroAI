a well-defined problem has:
a transition model that describes what state results from applying each of the agent's actions
	the effects of the agent's actions and how the world evolves independently of the agent
a set of initial states
a cost function
a set of goal states

the key difference between tree search and graph search are not: 
graph search allows for redundant paths

criteria for evaluation uninformed search:
completeness 
is the algorithm guaranteed to find a solution when there is one? 
	*when an algorithm is complete, it means that if at least one solution exists then the algorithm will find 
	a solution in a finite amount of time*
optimality
does the algorithm find the optimal solution?
time complexity: the number of nodes generated during search
how long does it take to find a solution? 
space complexity: the maximum number of nodes stored in memory
how much memory is needed to perform the search?
